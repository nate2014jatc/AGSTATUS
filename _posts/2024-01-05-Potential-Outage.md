On January 6th, 2024 at 15:00 Mountain Time, we will have a Google Fiber technician come by.
They will be investigating why we are getting approximately half the speeds we are expecting from our connection.

Part of this maintenance and investigation may require replacing a strand of fiber from our distribution box to the terminaltion point.
This may lead to unforseen downtime. 

Please plan for services to be down from 15:00 to around 17:00 Mountain time for this technician visit.
